      "We previously published Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework to provide guidance for technology leaders who \n",

      "covers AI challenges around people, data, technology, and process, structured in six different themes: learn, lead, \n",
      "access, secure, scale, and automate. \n",
      "The current document takes a deeper dive into the themes of scale and automate to illustrate the requirements for \n",
      "building and operationalizing ML systems. Scale concerns the extent to which you use cloud managed ML services \n",
      "that scale with large amounts of data and large numbers of data processing and ML jobs, with reduced operational \n",

      "processing and ML pipelines in production efficiently, frequently, and reliably.\n",
      "We outline an MLOps framework that defines core processes and technical capabilities. Organizations can use this \n",
      "framework to help establish mature MLOps practices for building and operationalizing ML systems. Adopting the \n",
      "framework can help organizations improve collaboration between teams, improve the reliability and scalability of ML \n",
      "systems, and shorten development cycle times. These benefits in turn drive innovation and help gain overall busi-\n",

      "This document is intended for technology leaders and enterprise architects who want to understand MLOps. It’s also \n",

      "The document is in two parts. The first part, an overview of the MLOps lifecycle, is for all readers. It introduces \n",
      "MLOps processes and capabilities and why they’re important for successful adoption of ML-based systems.\n",

      "Dataset management\n",
      "Features can be used in many datasets for multiple ML tasks and use cases, while a dataset is used for a particular \n",
      "ML task or use case. More precisely, feature repositories typically don’t include labeled data instances (instances \n",
      "with predictable targets). Instead, they include reusable feature values of various entities. The features of different \n",
      "entities can be combined and joined with other transactional data that contains labels in order to create a dataset.\n",
      "For example, the feature repository might contain a customer entity that includes features that describe customer\n",
      "\n",
      "demographics, purchase behavior, social media interactions, sentiment scores, third-party financial flags, and so on. \n",
      "The customer entity can be used in several tasks, such as churn prediction, click-through rate prediction, customer \n",

      "supervised learning tasks, each dataset has its own labels.\n",
      "Dataset management helps with the following:\n",
      "• Maintaining scripts for creating datasets and splits so that datasets can be created in different environments \n",
      "(development, test, production, and so on).\n",
      "• Maintaining a single dataset definition and realization within the team to use in various model implementa-\n",

      "• Maintaining metadata and annotation that can be useful for team members who are collaborating on the \n",

      "maintain compliance with regulations. \n",
      "To help with this task, organizations need to establish robust model management. Model management is a \n",
      "cross-cutting process that is at the center of MLOps. It entails both ML metadata tracking and model governance. \n",
      "Having model management across the ML lifecycle helps ensure the following:\n",
      "• The data that is being collected and used for model training and evaluation is accurate, unbiased, and used \n",
      "appropriately without any data privacy violations.\n",
      "• The models are evaluated and validated against effectiveness quality measures and fairness indicators, so \n",

      "Figure 13. Metadata tracking\n",
      "\n",
      "33\n",
      "ML metadata tracking is generally integrated with different MLOps processes. The artifacts produced by the other \n",
      "processes are usually automatically stored in an ML artifact repository, along with the information about the process \n",
      "executions. ML metadata that is captured can include pipeline run ID, trigger, process type, step, start and end date-\n",

      "ML metadata tracking lets data scientists and ML engineers track experimentation parameters and pipeline config-\n",

      "export existing ML models and artifacts. \n",
      "Data scientists and ML engineers can use ML metadata tracking to add and update annotations to the tracked ML \n",

      "data scientists and ML engineers understand the behavior of the pipelines and to debug ML issues.\n",
      "Model governance\n",
      "Model governance is about registering, reviewing, validating, and approving models for deployment. Depending on\n",
      "\n",
      "the organization, on the regulatory requirements of the model, and on the particular use case, the process of model \n",
      "governance can differ. The process can be automated, semi-automated, or fully automated (with multiple release \n",
      "criteria in all cases) to determine whether ML models are ready to go to production. In addition, model governance \n",
      "should support reporting on the performance of deployed models.\n",

      "\n",
      "34\n",
      "Figure 14 shows the tasks that are involved in model governance.\n",
      "Model governance can use information in the ML metadata and the model registry to do the following tasks:\n",
      "• Store: Add or update model properties and track model versions and property changes. The model registry can \n",
      "store many model versions from the experimentation and continuous training phases, which lets data scientists \n",
      "easily reproduce significant models.\n",
      "• Evaluate: Compare a new challenger model to the champion model by looking not only at evaluation metrics \n",
      "(accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and so on) but also at business KPIs that are collected through online ex-\n",

      "• Check: Review, request changes, and approve the model to help control for risks, such as business, financial, \n",
      "legal, security, privacy, reputational, and ethical concerns.\n",
      "• Release: Invoke the model deployment process to go live. This controls the type of the model release (for exam-\n",

      "• Report: Aggregate, visualize, and highlight model performance metrics that are collected from the continuous \n",
      "evaluation process. This ensures the quality of the model in production.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explainability is particularly important in the case of decision automation. The governance process should provide \n",
