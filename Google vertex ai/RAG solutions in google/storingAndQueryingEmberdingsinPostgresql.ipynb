    "# Overview\n",
    "This lab demonstrates how to easily integrate generative AI features into your applications with just a few lines of code using pgvector, LangChain, and LLMs on Google Cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a sample Python application together that will be able to understand and respond to human language queries about the relational data stored in your PostgreSQL database. In fact, we will further push the creative limits of the application by teaching it to generate new content based on our existing dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab utilizes an example of an e-commerce company that operates an online marketplace for buying and selling children's toys. The company aims to incorporate new generative AI experiences into its e-commerce applications for both buyers and sellers on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The goals are:\n",
    "\n",
    "(Usecase 1) For buyers: Build a new AI-powered hybrid search, where users can describe their needs in simple English text, along with regular filters (like price, etc.) (Usecase 2) For sellers: Add a new AI-powered content generation feature, where sellers will get auto-generated item description suggestions for new products that they want to add to the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset: The dataset for this lab has been sampled and created from a larger public retail dataset available at Kaggle. The sampled dataset used in this lab has only about 800 toy products, while the public dataset has over 370,000 products in different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "At the end of this lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have a good understanding of how to use the pgvector extension to store and search vector embeddings in PostgreSQL. Learn more about vector embeddings.\n",
    "You will get a hands-on experience with using the open-source LangChain framework to develop applications powered by large language models. LangChain makes it easier to develop and deploy applications against any LLM model in a vendor-agnostic manner.\n",
    "You will learn about the powerful features in Google PaLM models made available through Vertex AI."
