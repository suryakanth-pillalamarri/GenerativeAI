He was a son of a maid-servant who served the queens of Hastinapura — Ambika and Ambālika. In some accounts, he was an incarnation of Yama or Dharma Raja, who was cursed by the sage, Mandavya, for imposing punishment on him that exceed the sin.  Both queens were married to King Vichitravirya of Hastinapur, who died childless. Vichitravirya\\'s mother Satyavati was anxious to ensure that the royal line was continued so she called upon her other son Vyāsa (born of Satyavati – a fisherwoman, and Paraśara muni), to go to the beds of the two queens to father children. Vyāsa was a hermit, and came to the palace, unkempt as he was. He went to Ambika first who closed her eyes when she saw him, and then to Ambālika who became pale. Hence the children they bore were blind and weak respectively.  When Satyavati asked Vyāsa to go to Ambika\\'s bed again, to ensure that there would be children, she sent her maid-servant instead. The maid-servant was not frightened by his appearance and in fact received the sage with great respect and waited upon him with affection.  Thus, Vidura was born to a Sudra woman and was raised as brother of Dhritarashtra and Pandu.  Along with his half-brothers he was educated by Bhishma, whom they all called father. As he had no royal blood, Vidura was never considered for, or had any chance of obtaining the throne of the kingdom. He served his two brothers as a minister,  After Krishna, Vidura was the most trusted advisor to the Pandavas and had warned them repeatedly about Duryodhana\\'s plots, In particular, he warned the Pandavas from Duryodhana\\'s plan to burn them alive in a house of wax he had made for them. He was known for speaking the truth and for his expansive knowledge and sharp intelligence.   FOREWORD The importance of this text cannot be underestimated. The centre of Hinduism is the home and the householder is held up as the ideal. Since the rise of the monastic movements in India the focus has shifted from the house to the ashram. The elevated status of the householder has been usurped by the monks, and most Hindu teaching nowadays centers on the Upanishads and Vedanta. The trivarga purushārthas: Dharma (ethics), Artha (material success) and Kāma (pleasure and enjoyment) have become totally neglected and only the fourth (apavarga) — Mokṣa is discoursed on. Thus we find in all teaching sessions only retirees are present. The sanyasi teaching has little relevance for the householders. Brahmarishi Sri Devraha baba famously said - \" there is no greater Sanyāsa than being in Grihastha-āśrama.\" The alternative way forward is the teaching of the Nīti Śāstras to the youth and to householders. And of the Nīti literature Vidura Nīti is a great place to start. The original text contains a lot more subject matter plus two stories with more didactic matter imbedded in them. The topics in the original do not flow together and jump around considerably so I have taken the liberty of rearranging the verses according to topic and deleting those verses which were too obscure or irrelevant. There are several versions of the                                                    1 Vidura means inteligent, skilled, wise.  2 (http://bombay.indology.info/mahabharata/statement.html for further details) V '),\n",

I have used for reference the Gorakhpur Hindi translation and the Sanskrit E-text from Bhandakar Oriental Research Institute, Pune2.  The setting of the teaching is the palace of Dhritarasthra, the blind king whose sons - the Kauravas are about to engage in a fratricidal war with their cousins the Pandavas for the kingdom. The king has just been visited by his charioteer Sanjaya, who brought a message from the Pandavas entreating a reconciliation.   \"Sanjaya said,   Consider, O king, your own acts which are contrary to both Dharma and profit, and to the behavior of those that are righteous. O king, you have earned a bad reputation in this world, and will reap misery in the next. Obeying the advice of your son you hope  to enjoy this doubtful property, while excluding them. This unrighteous and unworthy deed is loudly proclaimed in the world. Calamity overtakes one who is deficient in wisdom, or who is of low birth, or who is cruel, or who cherishes  hostility for a long time, or who is not steady in Kshatriya chivalry, or is devoid of energy, or is of a bad disposition.  What person is there, who, attended upon by the greatest of counselors, possessed of intelligence, capable of discriminating between virtue and vice in times of distress, knowing the protocols of Dharma, and retaining the use of all his faculties, would commit such cruel deeds. These courtiers, devoted to you, wait here united in their firm determination (viz., that the Pandavas are not to get back their share). The destruction of the Kurus, therefore, is certain to be brought about by the force of circumstances.  A man is praised when he behaves honestly. You I blame, since these dissensions will surely bring about the destruction of innumerable lives. If you don\\'t make peace, then through your fault Arjuna will consume the Kurus like a blazing fire consuming a heap of dried grass. Your majesty, you alone, yielding to your uncontrollable son, had regarded yourself as crowned with success, and abstained from intervening at the time of the gambling fiasco. You will surely see now the fruit of that (weakness of yours)!   After delivering his message and severely rebuking the king, Sanjaya retired for the night to prepare for his address to the assembled kurus on the next day.

    "In the context of text processing, particularly when using tools like the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` in LangChain, \"character-character\" splitting refers to the method of dividing text into smaller segments based on individual characters. This approach is particularly useful for managing and processing large texts in a way that maintains context and coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Character-Character Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**: Character-character splitting involves breaking down a string of text into smaller chunks based on a specified number of characters. Each chunk can be defined by parameters such as `chunk_size` (the maximum number of characters in each chunk) and `chunk_overlap` (the number of characters that overlap between consecutive chunks).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How It Works**:\n",
    "   - **Chunk Size**: This parameter determines the maximum length of each chunk. For example, if `chunk_size` is set to 200, each chunk will contain up to 200 characters.\n",
    "   - **Chunk Overlap**: This parameter specifies how many characters from the end of one chunk will be included at the beginning of the next chunk. For example, if `chunk_overlap` is set to 20, the last 20 characters of one chunk will be repeated at the start of the next chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example**:\n",
    "   Suppose you have the following text:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \"LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   If you set `chunk_size=50` and `chunk_overlap=10`, the text might be split into chunks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Chunk 1**: \"LangChain is a framework for developing\"\n",
    "   - **Chunk 2**: \"g applications powered by language mo\"\n",
    "   - **Chunk 3**: \"del models.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, the overlap ensures that the transition between chunks retains some context, which can be crucial for understanding the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases for Character-Character Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: When working with language models, maintaining context is essential. Character-character splitting helps ensure that models have enough information to generate coherent responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Analysis**: For tasks like sentiment analysis or topic modeling, splitting text into manageable chunks allows for more efficient processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Summarization**: When summarizing long documents, overlapping chunks can help capture key ideas that might span across chunk boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Preparation**: In machine learning, preparing text data in smaller, contextually relevant chunks can improve model training and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Character-Character Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contextual Integrity**: Overlapping chunks help maintain the flow of information, reducing the risk of losing important context.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: This method can be easily adjusted by changing the `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` parameters to suit different types of text and processing needs.\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Character-based splitting is straightforward and can be applied to any text without requiring complex parsing or tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Character-character splitting is a useful technique in text processing that allows for the effective management of large texts while preserving context. By adjusting the chunk size and overlap, you can tailor the splitting process to meet the specific needs of your application, whether it's for natural language processing, text analysis, or data preparation."

He was a son of a maid-servant who served the queens of Hastinapura — Ambika and Ambālika. In some accounts, he was an incarnation of Yama or Dharma Raja, who was cursed by the sage, Mandavya, for imposing punishment on him that exceed the sin.  Both queens were married to King Vichitravirya of Hastinapur, who died childless. Vichitravirya\\'s mother Satyavati was anxious to ensure that the royal line was continued so she called upon her other son Vyāsa (born of Satyavati – a fisherwoman, and Paraśara muni), to go to the beds of the two queens to father children. Vyāsa was a hermit, and came to the palace, unkempt as he was. He went to Ambika first who closed her eyes when she saw him, and then to Ambālika who became pale. Hence the children they bore were blind and weak respectively.  When Satyavati asked Vyāsa to go to Ambika\\'s bed again, to ensure that there would be children, she sent her maid-servant instead. The maid-servant was not frightened by his appearance and in fact received the sage with great respect and waited upon him with affection.  Thus, Vidura was born to a Sudra woman and was raised as brother of Dhritarashtra and Pandu.  Along with his half-brothers he was educated by Bhishma, whom they all called father. As he had no royal blood, Vidura was never considered for, or had any chance of obtaining the throne of the kingdom. He served his two brothers as a minister,  After Krishna, Vidura was the most trusted advisor to the Pandavas and had warned them repeatedly about Duryodhana\\'s plots, In particular, he warned the Pandavas from Duryodhana\\'s plan to burn them alive in a house of wax he had made for them. He was known for speaking the truth and for his expansive knowledge and sharp intelligence.   FOREWORD The importance of this text cannot be underestimated. The centre of Hinduism is the home and the householder is held up as the ideal. Since the rise of the monastic movements in India the focus has shifted from the house to the ashram. The elevated status of the householder has been usurped by the monks, and most Hindu teaching nowadays centers on the Upanishads and Vedanta. The trivarga purushārthas: Dharma (ethics), Artha (material success) and Kāma (pleasure and enjoyment) have become totally neglected and only the fourth (apavarga) — Mokṣa is discoursed on. Thus we find in all teaching sessions only retirees are present. The sanyasi teaching has little relevance for the householders. Brahmarishi Sri Devraha baba famously said - \" there is no greater Sanyāsa than being in Grihastha-āśrama.\" The alternative way forward is the teaching of the Nīti Śāstras to the youth and to householders. And of the Nīti literature Vidura Nīti is a great place to start. The original text contains a lot more subject matter plus two stories with more didactic matter imbedded in them. The topics in the original do not flow together and jump around considerably so I have taken the liberty of rearranging the verses according to topic and deleting those verses which were too obscure or irrelevant. There are several versions of the                                                    1 Vidura means inteligent, skilled, wise.  2 (http://bombay.indology.info/mahabharata/statement.html for further details) V'),\n",

I have used for reference the Gorakhpur Hindi translation and the Sanskrit E-text from Bhandakar Oriental Research Institute, Pune2.  The setting of the teaching is the palace of Dhritarasthra, the blind king whose sons - the Kauravas are about to engage in a fratricidal war with their cousins the Pandavas for the kingdom. The king has just been visited by his charioteer Sanjaya, who brought a message from the Pandavas entreating a reconciliation.   \"Sanjaya said,   Consider, O king, your own acts which are contrary to both Dharma and profit, and to the behavior of those that are righteous. O king, you have earned a bad reputation in this world, and will reap misery in the next. Obeying the advice of your son you hope  to enjoy this doubtful property, while excluding them. This unrighteous and unworthy deed is loudly proclaimed in the world. Calamity overtakes one who is deficient in wisdom, or who is of low birth, or who is cruel, or who cherishes  hostility for a long time, or who is not steady in Kshatriya chivalry, or is devoid of energy, or is of a bad disposition.  What person is there, who, attended upon by the greatest of counselors, possessed of intelligence, capable of discriminating between virtue and vice in times of distress, knowing the protocols of Dharma, and retaining the use of all his faculties, would commit such cruel deeds. These courtiers, devoted to you, wait here united in their firm determination (viz., that the Pandavas are not to get back their share). The destruction of the Kurus, therefore, is certain to be brought about by the force of circumstances.  A man is praised when he behaves honestly. You I blame, since these dissensions will surely bring about the destruction of innumerable lives. If you don\\'t make peace, then through your fault Arjuna will consume the Kurus like a blazing fire consuming a heap of dried grass. Your majesty, you alone, yielding to your uncontrollable son, had regarded yourself as crowned with success, and abstained from intervening at the time of the gambling fiasco. You will surely see now the fruit of that (weakness of yours)!   After delivering his message and severely rebuking the king, Sanjaya retired for the night to prepare for his address to the assembled kurus on the next day.

For example, `<h1>` tags typically represent main titles, while `<h2>` and `<h3>` tags represent subsections. An HTML Header Text Splitter can leverage this structure to create meaningful chunks of text.\n",

    "2. **Content Extraction**: The splitter can extract text content from specific header tags, allowing you to focus on relevant sections of the document. This is useful for summarizing content or for applications that require specific information from a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chunking Based on Headers**: By splitting text at header tags, you can create chunks that correspond to sections of the document. For example, if you have a document with multiple sections, each starting with an `<h2>` tag, the splitter can create separate chunks for each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parsing HTML**: The HTML Header Text Splitter first parses the HTML document to identify header tags and their associated content. This can be done using libraries like BeautifulSoup in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identifying Headers**: The splitter looks for specific header tags (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`) and uses them as delimiters to determine where to split the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating Chunks**: Once the headers are identified, the splitter creates chunks of text that include the header and the content that follows it until the next header of the same or higher level is encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following HTML snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<h1>Main Title</h1>\n",
    "<p>This is the introduction paragraph.</p>\n",
    "<h2>Subsection 1</h2>\n",
    "<p>This is the content for subsection 1.</p>\n",
    "<h2>Subsection 2</h2>\n",
    "<p>This is the content for subsection 2.</p>\n",
    "<h3>Sub-subsection 2.1</h3>\n",
    "<p>This is the content for sub-subsection 2.1.</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an HTML Header Text Splitter, you might get the following chunks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chunk 1**:\n",
    "   - Header: `Main Title`\n",
    "   - Content: `This is the introduction paragraph.`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chunk 2**:\n",
    "   - Header: `Subsection 1`\n",
    "   - Content: `This is the content for subsection 1.`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chunk 3**:\n",
    "   - Header: `Subsection 2`\n",
    "   - Content: `This is the content for subsection 2.`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Chunk 4**:\n",
    "   - Header: `Sub-subsection 2.1`\n",
    "   - Content: `This is the content for sub-subsection 2.1.`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Web Scraping**: When extracting information from web pages, using an HTML Header Text Splitter can help organize the data in a structured way.\n",
    "- **Content Summarization**: By splitting text based on headers, you can create summaries for each section of a document.\n",
    "- **Document Analysis**: Analyzing the structure of documents can provide insights into the organization of information, which is useful for various applications, including SEO and content management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTML Header Text Splitter is a valuable tool for processing HTML documents by leveraging the hierarchical structure defined by header tags. By extracting and organizing content based on these headers, you can create meaningful chunks of text that are easier to analyze, summarize, or use in applications. This approach is particularly useful in web scraping, content analysis, and natural language processing tasks."
