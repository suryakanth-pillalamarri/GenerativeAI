He wisheth \\nto behold thy feet. Command me as to what \\nhe is to do.\\'  \\n \\n। Vidura Niti  \\n4 ।  \\n॥ ५॥ \\n \\nThereupon Dhritarashtra said, \\'Let Vidura of \\ngreat wisdom and foresight enter. I am never \\nunwilling or unprepared to see Vidura.\\'  \\n  \\n। \\n।  \\n॥ ६॥ \\n \\nThe orderly then went out and spoke unto \\nVidura, \\'O Kshatri, enter the inner \\napartments of the wise king. The king says \\nthat he is never unwilling to see thee.\\'  \\n \\n। \\n।  \\n॥ ७॥ Vidura Niti  \\n5 ।  \\n॥ ८॥ \\n \\n\"Vaisampayana continued, \\'Having entered \\nDhritarashtra\\' s chamber, Vidura said with \\njoined hands unto that ruler of men who was \\nthen plunged in thought, \\'O thou of great \\nwisdom, I am Vidura, arrived here at thy \\ncommand.

He hath gone away after \\nrebuking me. Tomorrow he will deliver, in \\nthe midst of the court, Ajatasatru\\'s message. I \\nhave not been able today to ascertain what \\nthe message is of the Kuru hero. Therefore,  \\nmy body is burning, and that hath produced \\nsleeplessness. Tell us what may be good for a \\nperson that is sleepless and burning. Thou \\nart, O child, versed in both religion and \\nprofit. Ever since, Sanjaya hath returned \\nfrom the Pandavas, my heart knoweth no \\npeace. Filled with anxiety about what he Vidura Niti  \\n7 may deliver, all my senses have been \\ndisordered\\'.  \\n \\n। \\n।  \\n॥ १३॥ \\n।  \\n॥ १४॥ \\n \\n\"Vidura said, \\'Sleeplessness overtaketh thief, \\na lustful person, him that hath lost all his \\nwealth, him that hath failed to achieve \\nsuccess, and him also that is weak and hath \\nbeen attacked by a strong person. I hope, O \\nking, that none of these grave calamities \\nhave overtaken thee. I hope, thou dost not \\ngrieve, coveting the wealth of others.\\'  \\n \\n। \\n।  Vidura Niti  \\n8 ॥ १५॥ \\n \\n\"Dhr itarashtra said, \\'I desire to hear from \\nthee words that are beneficial and fraught \\nwith high morality. In this race of royal \\nRishis thou alone art reverenced by the wise.  \\n \\n। \\n। \\n॥- ॥ \\n \\n\\'Vidura replied, \\'King (Yudhishthira), graced \\nwith every virtue, is worthy of being the \\nsovereign of the three worlds; yet, O \\nDhritarashtra, however worthy of being kept \\nby thy side, he was exiled by thee.  \\n \\n। \\n॥- ॥ \\n Vidura Niti  \\n9 Thou art, however, possessed of qualities \\nwhich are thy very reverse of those \\npossessed by him. Although virtuous and \\nversed in morality, thou hast yet no right to a \\nshare  in the kingdom owing to thy loss of \\nsight.  \\n \\n। \\n॥- ॥ \\n \\nIn consequence of his inoffensiveness and \\nkindness, his righteousness, love of truth and \\nenergy, and his r emembering the reverence \\nthat is due to thee, Yudhishthira patiently \\nbears innumerable wrongs.  \\n \\n। \\n॥- ॥ \\nHaving bestowed on Duryodhana and \\nSuvala\\'s son and Karna, and Dussasana the \\nmanagement of the empire, how canst thou \\nhope for prosperity?  Vidura Niti  \\n10  \\n। \\n॥- ॥ \\n \\nHe that is not served from the high ends of \\nlife by the aid of self -knowledge, exertion, \\nforbearance and s teadiness in virtue, is called \\nwise.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ १६॥ \\n \\nThese again are the marks of a wise man, \\nviz., adherence to acts, worthy of praise and \\nrejection of what is blamable, faith, and \\nreverence.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ १७॥ \\n Vidura Niti  \\n11 He whom neither anger nor joy, nor pride, \\nnor false modesty, nor stupefaction, nor \\nvanity, can draw away from the high ends of \\nlife, is considered a s wise.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ १८॥ \\n \\nHe whose intended acts, and proposed \\ncounsels remain concealed from foes, and \\nwhose acts become known only after they \\nhave been done, is considered wise . \\n \\n।  \\n॥ १९॥ \\n \\nHe whose proposed actions are never \\nobstructed by heat or cold, fear of \\nattachment, prosperity or adversity, is \\nconsidered wise.  \\n Vidura Niti  \\n12 ।  \\n॥ २०॥ \\n \\nHe whose judgment dissociated from desire, \\nfolloweth both virtue and profit, and who \\ndisregarding pleasure chooseth such ends as \\nare serviceable in both worlds, is co nsidered \\nwise.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ २१॥ \\n \\nThey that exert to the best of their might, and \\nact also to the best of their might, and \\ndisregard nothing as insignificant, are called \\nwise.  \\n \\n \\n।  \\n Vidura Niti  \\n13 ॥ २२॥ \\n \\nHe that understandeth quickly, listeneth \\npatiently, pursueth his objects with \\njudgment and not from desire and spendeth \\nnot his breath on the affairs of others without \\nbeing asked, is said to possess the foremost \\nmark of wisdom.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ २३॥ \\n \\nThey that do not strive for objects that are \\nunat tainable, that do not grieve for what is \\nlost and gone, that do not suffer their minds \\nto be clouded amid calamities, are regarded \\nto possess intellects endued with wisdom.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ २४॥ \\n Vidura Niti  \\n14 He who striveth, having commenced \\nanything, till it is completed, who never \\nwasteth his time, and who hath his soul \\nunder control, is regarded wise.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ २५॥ \\n \\nThey that are wise, O bull of the Bharata \\nrace, always delight in honest deeds, do \\nwhat tendeth to their happiness and \\nprosperity, and never sneer at what is good.  \\n।  \\n॥ २६॥ \\n \\nHe who exulteth not at honours, and \\ngrieveth not at slights, and remaineth cool \\nand unagitated like a lake in the course of \\nGanga, is reckoned as wise.  \\n \\n।  Vidura Niti  \\n15 ॥ २७॥ \\n \\nThat man who knowe th the nature of all \\ncreatures (viz., that everything is subject to \\ndestruction), who is cognisant also of the \\nconnections of all acts, and who is proficient \\nin the knowledge of the means that men may \\nresort to (for attaining their objects), is \\nreckoned as  wise.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ २८॥ \\nHe who speaketh boldly, can converse on \\nvarious subjects, knoweth the science of \\nargumentation, possesseth genius, and can \\ninterpret the meaning of what is wr it in \\nbooks, is reckoned as wise.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ २९॥ Vidura Niti  \\n16 He whose studies are regulated by reason, \\nand whose reason followeth the scriptures, \\nand who never abstaineth from paying \\nrespect to those that are good, is called a \\nwise man.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ३०॥ \\n \\nHe, on the other hand, who is ignorant of \\nscripture yet vain, poor yet proud, and who \\nresorteth to unfai r means for the acquisition \\nof his objects, is a fool.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ३१॥ \\n \\nHe who, forsaking his own, concerneth \\nhimself with the objects of others, and who \\npractiseth deceitful means for serving his \\nfriends, is called a fool.  Vidura Niti  \\n17 । \\n॥- ॥ \\n \\nHe who wisheth for those things that should \\nnot be desired, and forsaketh those that may \\nlegitimately be desired, and who beareth  \\nmalice to those that are powerful, is regarded \\nto be a foolish soul.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ३३॥ \\n \\nHe who regardeth his foe as his friend, who \\nhateth and beareth malice to his friend, and \\nwho committeth wicked deeds, is said to be a \\nperson of foolish soul.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ३४॥ \\n Vidura Niti  \\n18 O bull of the Bharata race, he who divulgeth \\nhis projects, doubteth in all things, and \\nspendeth a lon g time in doing what \\nrequireth a short time, is a fool.  \\n \\n। \\n॥- ॥ \\n \\nHe who doth not perform the Sraddha for \\nthe Pitris, nor worshippeth the deities, nor \\nacquireth noble -minded frie nds, is said to be \\na person of foolish soul.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ३५॥ \\n \\nThat worst of men who entereth a place \\nuninvited, and talketh much without being \\nasked, and reposeth trust on untrustworthy \\nwight s, is a fool.  \\n Vidura Niti  \\n19 ।  \\n॥ ३६॥ \\n \\nThat man who being himself guilty casteth \\nthe blame on others, and who though \\nimpotent giveth vent to anger, is the most \\nfoolish of men.  \\n \\nबलम ।  \\n॥ ३७॥ \\n \\nThat man, who, without knowing his own \\nstrength and dissociated from both virtue \\nand profit, desireth an object difficult of \\nacquisition, without again adopting \\nadequate means, is said to be destitute of \\nintelligence.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ३८॥ \\n Vidura Niti  \\n20 O king, he who punisheth one that is \\nundeserving of punishment, payeth homage \\nto persons without their knowledge, and \\nwaiteth upon m isers, is said to be of little \\nsense.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ३९॥ \\n \\nBut he that, having attained immense wealth \\nand prosperity or acquired (vast) learning, \\ndoth not bear himself haughtily, is recko ned \\nas wise.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ४०॥ \\n \\nWho, again, is more heartless than he, who, \\nthough possessed of affluence, eateth himself \\nand weareth excellent robes himself without \\ndistributing his wealth among his \\ndependents?  Vidura Niti  \\n21 ।  \\n॥ ४१॥ \\n \\nWhile one person committeth sins, many \\nreap the advantage resulting therefrom; (yet \\nin the end) it is the doer alone to whom the \\nsin at tacheth while those that enjoy the fruit \\nescape unhurt.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ४२॥ \\n \\nWhen a bowman shooteth an arrow, he may \\nor may not succeed in slaying even a single \\nperson, but when an intelligent individual \\napplieth his intelligence (viciously); it may \\ndestroy an entire kingdom with the king.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ४३॥ Vidura Niti  \\n22 Discriminating the two  (what is to be  done \\nand what is not to be done)  by means of the \\none (the intellect) , bring under thy subjection \\nthe three  (friend, enenmy and the neutral \\nperson)  by means of four  (the f our means of \\nsuccess against an enemy – sama, \\nreconciliation or negotiation;  dana, bribery ; \\nbheda,  sowing dissensions and danda,  \\npunishment) , and also conquering the five  \\n(senses of perception)  and knowing the six  \\n(six expedients to be used in foeign politics – \\nsandhi, vigraha, yana, aasana, dvaidhibhava and \\nsamshraya)  and abstaining from the seven  \\n(woman, gambling, hunting, intoxicants, harsh \\nspeech, harsh punishment and amassing wealth \\nusing unjust means ), be happy.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ४४॥ \\n \\nPoison sl ayeth but one person, and a weapon \\nalso but one; wicked counsels, however, Vidura Niti  \\n23 destroy an entire kingdom with king and \\nsubject.  \\n।  \\n॥ ४५॥ \\n \\nAlone one should not partake of any  savoury \\nviand, nor alone reflect on concerns of profit, \\nnor alone go upon a journey, nor alone \\nremain awake among sleeping companions.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ४६॥ \\n \\nThat Being who is One without a second, \\nand whom, O king, thou hast not been able \\nto comprehend, is Truth\\'s self, and the Way \\nto heaven, even like a boat in the ocean.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ४७॥ \\n Vidura Niti  \\n24 There is one only defect in forgivi ng persons, \\nand not another; that defect is that people \\ntake a forgiving person to be weak.  \\n \\n। \\n॥- ॥ \\n \\nThat defect, however, should not be taken \\ninto consideration, for forgiveness is a great \\npower. Forgiveness is a virtue of the weak, \\nand an ornament of the strong.  \\n \\n। \\n॥- ॥ \\n \\nForgiveness subdueth (all) in this world; \\nwhat is there that forgi veness cannot \\nachieve? What can a wicked person do unto \\nhim who carrieth the sabre of forgiveness in \\nhis hand?  \\n Vidura Niti  \\n25  \\n। \\n॥- ॥ \\n \\nFire falling on a grassless ground is \\nextinguished of itsel f. And unforgiving \\nindividual defileth himself with many \\nenormities.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ४८॥ \\n \\nRighteousness is the one highest good; and \\nforgiveness is the one supreme peace; \\nknowledge is one supreme contentment; and \\nbenevolence, one sole happiness.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ४९॥ \\n Vidura Niti  \\n26 Even as a serpent devoureth animals living \\nin holes, the earth devoureth these two, viz., \\na king who i s incompetent to fight, and a \\nBrahmana who doth not sojourn to holy \\nplaces.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ५०॥ \\n \\nA man may attain renown in this world by \\ndoing two things, viz., by refraining from \\nharsh speech, and by disregarding those that \\nare wicked.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ५१॥ \\n \\nO tiger among men, these two have not a \\nwill of their own, viz., those women who \\ncovet men simply because th e latter are \\ncoveted by others of their sex, and that Vidura Niti  \\n27 person who worships another simply \\nbecause the latter is worshipped by others.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ५२॥ \\n \\nThese two are like sharp thorns affli cting the \\nbody, viz., the desires of a poor man, and the \\nanger of the impotent.  \\n \\n। \\n॥- ॥ \\n \\nThese two persons never shine because of \\ntheir incompatible acts, viz., a householder \\nwithout exertion, and a beggar busied in \\nschemes.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ५३॥ \\n Vidura Niti  \\n28 These two, O king, live (as it were) in a \\nregion higher than heaven itself, viz., a man \\nof power endued with  forgiveness, and poor \\nman that is charitable.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ५४॥ \\n \\nOf things honestly got, these two must be \\nlooked upon as misuse, viz., making gifts to \\nthe unworthy and refusi ng the worthy.  \\n \\n। \\n॥- ॥ \\nThese two should be thrown into the water, \\ntightly binding weights to their necks, viz., a \\nwealthy man that doth not give away, and a \\npoor man that is proud.  \\n \\n। \\n॥- ॥ Vidura Niti  \\n29  \\nThese two, O tiger among men, can pierce \\nthe orb itself of the sun, viz., a mendicant \\naccomplished in yoga, and a warrior that \\nhath fallen in open fight.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ५५॥ \\n \\nO bull of the Bharata race, persons versed in \\nthe Vedas have said that men\\'s means are \\ngood, middling, and bad.  \\n  \\n।  \\n॥ ५६॥ \\n \\nMen also, O king, are good, indifferent, and \\nbad.

If, however, tho u art \\nin health, thou canst achieve thy good, for he \\nis dead who is unhealthy and ill.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥६६॥ \\n \\nO king, anger is a kind of bitter, pungent, \\nacrid, and hot drink, painful in its \\nconsequences: it  is a kind of headache not \\nborn of any physical illness, and they that are \\nunwise can never digest it.  Do thou, O  king, \\nswallow it up and obtain peace.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ \\n Vidura Niti  \\n127 They that are tortured by disease have no  \\nliking for enjoyments, nor do they desire any \\nhappines s from wealth. The sick, however, \\nfilled with sorrow, know not what happiness \\nis or what the enjoyments of wealth are.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ६८॥ \\n \\nBeholding Dra upadi won at dice, I told thee \\nbefore, O king, these words - They that are \\nhonest avoid deceit in play. Therefore, stop \\nDuryod hana! Thou didst not, however, act \\naccording to my words.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ६९॥ \\n \\nThat is not strength which is opposed to \\nsoftness.

The man that \\npursueth an object with perseve rance and \\nwithout giving it up in vexation, is really \\ngreat, and enjoyeth happiness that is \\nunending.  \\n \\n।  Vidura Niti  \\n193 ॥ ४५॥ \\n \\nO sire, there is nothing more conducive of \\nhappiness and nothing more proper for a \\nman o f power and energy as foregiveness in \\nevery place and at all times.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ४६॥ \\n \\nHe that is  weak should forgive under all \\ncircumstances. He that is possessed of power \\nshould show forgi veness from motives of \\nvirtue; and he, to whom the success or \\nfailure of his objects is the same, is naturally \\nforgiving.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ४७॥ \\n Vidura Niti  \\n194 That pleasure the pursuit of which dot h not \\ninjure one\\'s virtue and profit, should \\ncertainly be pursued to one\\'s fill. One should \\nnot, however, act like a fool by giving free \\nindulgence to his senses.  \\n  \\n।  \\n॥ ४८॥ \\n \\nProsperity never resides in one who suffers \\nhimself to be tortured by a grief, who is \\naddicted to evil ways, who denies Godhead, \\nwho is idle, who hath not his se nses under \\ncontrol, and who is divested of exertion.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ४९॥ \\n \\nThe man that is humble, and who from \\nhum ility is modest is regarded as weak and \\npersecuted by persons of misdirected \\nintelligence.

Prosperity doth not reside in \\none that is highly accomplished, nor in one \\nthat is without any accomplish ment. She \\ndoth not desire a combination of all the \\nvirtues, nor is she pleased with the total \\nabsence of all virtues. Blind, like  a mad cow, \\nprosperity resides with some one who is not \\nremarkable.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ५१॥ \\n Vidura Niti  \\n196 The frui ts of the Vedas are ceremonies \\nperformed before the (homa) fire; the fruits \\nof an acquaintan ce wi th the scriptures are \\ngoodness of disposition and conduct.  The \\nfruits of women are the pleasures  of \\nintercourse and offspring; and the fruits of \\nwealth are enjoyment and charity.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ५२॥ \\n \\nHe that perform eth acts tending to secure his \\nprosperity in the other world with wealth \\nacquired sinfully, never reape th the fruits of \\nthese acts in the other world, in consequence \\nof the sinfulness of the acquisitions (spent  for \\nthe purpose).  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ५३॥ \\n Vidura Niti  \\n197 In the midst of deserts, or deep woods, or \\ninaccessible fastnesses, amid all kinds of \\ndangers and alarms or in view of deadly \\nweapons upraise d for striking him, he that \\nhath strength of mind entertaineth no fear.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ५४॥ \\n \\nExertion, self -control, skill, carefulness, \\nsteadiness, memory, and commencement of \\nacts after mature deli beration, -know that \\nthese are the roots of prosperity.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ५५॥ \\n \\nAusterities constitute the strength of asceti cs; \\nthe Vedas are the strength of those \\nconversa nt with them; in envy lieth the \\nstrength of the w icked; and in forgiveness, \\nthe strength of the virtuous.  Vidura Niti  \\n198 ।  \\n॥ ५६॥ \\n \\nThese eight, viz., water, roots, fruits, milk, \\nclarified butte r (what is done at) the desire of \\na Brahmana, (or at) the command of a \\npreceptor, and medicine, are not destructive \\nof a vow.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ५७॥ \\n \\nThat which is antagonistic to one\\'s  own se lf, \\nshould never be applied in respect of \\nanother. Briefly even this is virtue. Other \\nkinds of virtue there are, but these proceed \\nfrom caprice.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ५८॥ Vidura Niti  \\n199 Anger must be conquered by forgiveness; \\nand the wicked must be conquered by \\nhonesty; the miser must be conquered by \\nliberality, and falsehood must be conquered \\nby truth.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ५९॥ \\n \\nOne should not place trust on a woman, a \\nswindler, an idle person,  a coward, one that \\nis fierce, one that boasts of his own power, a \\nthief, an ungrateful person, and an atheist.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ६०॥ \\n \\nAchievements, period of life, fame, and \\npower --these four always expand in the  case \\nof him that respectfully saluteth his \\nsuperiors and waiteth upon the old.  Vidura Niti  \\n200 ।  \\n॥ ६१॥ \\n \\nDo not set thy h eart after these objects which \\ncannot be acquired except by very painful \\nexertion, or by sacrifici ng righteousness, or \\nby bowing down to an enemy.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ६२॥ \\n \\nA man without knowledge is to be pitied; an \\nact of intercourse that is not fruitful is to be \\npitied; the people of a kingdom that are \\nwithou t food are to be pitied; and a kingdom \\nwithout a king is to b e pitied.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ६३॥ \\n Vidura Niti  \\n201 These constitute the source of pain and \\nweakness to embodied creatures; the rains, \\ndecay of hills and mountains; ab sence of \\nenjoyment, anguish of women; and wordy \\narrows of the heart.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ६४॥ \\n \\nThe scum of the Vedas i s want of study; of \\nBrahmanas, absence of vows; of t he chaste \\nwoman, curiosity; of women, exile from \\nhome.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ६५॥ \\n \\nThe scum of gold is silver; of silver, t in; of \\ntin, lead; and of lead, useless dross.  \\n \\n।  Vidura Niti  \\n202 ॥ ६६॥ \\n \\nOne cannot conquer sleep by lying down; \\nwomen by desire; fire by fuel; and wine by \\ndrinking.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ६७॥ \\n \\nHis life is, indeed, crowned with success \\nwho hath won his friends by gifts, his foes in \\nbattle, and wife by food and drink.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ६८॥ \\n \\nThey who have thousands live; they, who \\nhave hundreds, also live.

Students, again, engaged in the \\npursuit of learning, cannot have pleasure. \\nVotaries of pleasure must give up  \\nknowledge, and votaries of knowledge must \\ngive up pleasure.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ ६॥ \\n \\nFire is never gratified with fuel (but can \\nconsume any measure thereof). The great \\nocean is never gratif ied with the rivers it \\nreceives (but can receive any number of \\nthem). Death is ne ver gratified even with \\nentire living creatures.

Know, O king, that those are \\nregions where the sense s of men are \\nexceedingly afflicted.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥१८ \\n \\nOh, let not any of those places to thine. \\nCarefull y listening to these words, if thou Vidura Niti  \\n212 canst act according to them, thou wilt obtain \\ngreat fame in this world  of men, and fear will \\nnot be thine here or hereafter.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ \\n \\nO Bharata, the soul is spoken of as a river; \\nreligious merit constitutes its sacred baths; \\ntruth, its water; self -control, its banks; \\nkindness, its waves.  He that is righteous \\npurifieth himself by a bath therein, for the \\nsoul is sac red, and the absence of desire is \\nthe h ighest merit.  \\n \\n।  \\n॥ २०॥ \\n \\nO king, life is a river whose waters are the \\nfive senses, and whose crocodiles and sharks \\nare desire and anger.

       "'Yaksha Prashna\\nयǘ ĲŬन\\nThe Story of the Righteous Crane\\nMahabharata, Aranya Parva , 311–12\\nVaisampayana said, ‘Yudhishthira saw his brothers, each possessed of the glory of\\nIndra himself, lying dead like the Regents of the world dropped from their spheres\\nat the end of the Yuga. And beholding Arjuna lying dead, with his bow and arrows\\ndropped on the ground, and also Bhimasena and the twins motionless and deprived\\nof life, the king breathed a hot and long sigh, and was bathed in tears of grief.\\nAnd beholding his brothers lying dead, the mighty armed son of Dharma with heart\\nracked in anxiety, began to lament profusely, saying, “Thou hadst, O mighty-armed\\nVrikodara, vowed, saying,— I shall with mace smash the thighs of Duryodhana in battle!\\nO enhancer of the glory of the Kurus, in thy death, O mighty-armed and high-souled\\none, all that hath become fruitless now! The promises of men may be ineffectual;\\nbut why have the words of the gods uttered in respect of thee been thus fruitless? O\\nDhananjaya, while thou wert in thy mother’s lying-in-room, the gods had said,— O\\nKunti, this thy son shall not be inferior to him of a thousand eyes! And in the northern\\nParipatra mountains, all beings had sung, saying,— The prosperity of this race, robbed by\\nfoes will be recovered by this one without delay. No one will be able to vanquish him in battle,\\nwhile there will be none whom he will not be able to vanquish. Why then hath that Jishnu\\nendued with great strength been subject to death? Oh, why doth that Dhananjaya,\\nrelying on whom we had hitherto endured all this misery, lie on the ground blighting\\nall my hopes! Why have those heroes, those mighty sons of Kunti, Bhimasena and\\nDhananjaya, came under the power of the enemy,—those who themselves always\\nslew their foes, and whom no weapons could resist! Surely, this vile heart of mine\\nmust be made of adamant, since, beholding these twins lying today on the ground\\nit doth not split! Ye bulls among men, versed in holy writ and acquainted with the\\nproperties of time and place, and endued with ascetic merit, ye who duly performed\\nall sacred rites, why lie ye down, without performing acts deserving of you? Alas, why\\nlie ye insensible on the earth, with your bodies unwounded, ye unvanquished ones,\\nand with your vows untouched?”\\nAnd beholding his brothers sweetly sleeping there as they usually did on mountain\\nslopes, the high souled king, overwhelmed with grief and bathed in sweat, came to a\\ndistressful condition. And saying,—“It is even so”, that virtuous lord of men, immersed\\nin an ocean of grief anxiously proceeded to ascertain the cause of that catastrophe.\\nAnd that mighty-armed and high-souled one, acquainted with the divisions of time\\nand place, could not settle his course of action. Having thus bewailed much in this\\n1\\uf779\\uf761\\uf76b\\uf773\\uf768\\uf761 \\uf770\\uf772\\uf761\\uf773\\uf768\\uf76e\\uf761\\nstrain, the virtuous Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma or Tapu, restrained his soul and\\nbegan to reflect in his mind as to who had slain those heroes. “There are no strokes\\nof weapons upon these, nor is any one’s foot-print here. The being must be mighty I\\nween, by whom my brothers have been slain. Earnestly shall I ponder over this, or, let\\nme first drink of the water, and then know all. It may be that the habitually crooked-\\nminded Duryodhana hath caused this water to be secretly placed here by the king of\\nthe Gandharvas. What man of sense can trust wicked wight of evil passions with whom\\ngood and evil are alike? Or, perhaps, this may be an act of that wicked-souled one\\nthrough secret messengers of his.” And it was thus that that highly intelligent one gave\\nway to diverse reflections. He did not believe that water to have been tainted with\\npoison, for though dead no corpse-like pallor was on them. “The colour on the faces of\\nthese my brothers hath not faded!” And it was thus that Yudhishthira thought. And the\\nking continued, “Each of these foremost of men was like unto a mighty cataract. Who,\\ntherefore, save Yama himself who in due time bringeth about the end of all things,\\ncould have baffled them thus.” And having concluded this for certain, he began to\\nperform his ablutions in that lake. And while he descended into it, he heard these\\nwords from the sky, uttered by the Yaksha,—“I am a crane, living on tiny fish. It is\\nby me that thy younger brothers have been brought under the sway of the lord of\\ndeparted spirits. If, thou, O prince, answer not the questions put by me, even thou\\nshalt number the fifth corpse. Do not, O child, act rashly! This lake hath already been\\nin my possession. Having answered my questions first, do thou, O Kunti’s son, drink\\nand carry away as much as thou requirest!” Hearing these words, Yudhishthira said,\\n“Art thou the foremost of the Rudras, or of the Vasus, or of the Marutas? I ask, what\\ngod art thou? This could not have been done by a bird! Who is it that hath overthrown\\nthe four mighty mountains, the Himavat, the Paripatra, the Vindhya, and the Malaya?\\nGreat is the feat done by thee, thou foremost of strong persons! Those whom neither\\ngods, nor Gandharvas nor Asuras, nor Rakshasas could endure in mighty conflict,\\nhave been slain by thee! Therefore, exceedingly wonderful is the deed done by thee!\\nI do not know what thy business may be, nor do I know thy purpose. Therefore, great\\nis the curiosity and fear also that have taken possession of me? My mind is greatly\\nagitated, and as my head also is aching, I ask thee, therefore, O worshipful one, who\\nart thou that stayest here?” Hearing these words the Yaksha said, “I am, good betide\\nthee, a Yaksha, and not an amphibious bird. It is by me that all these brothers of thine,\\nendued with mighty prowess, have been slain!”\\nVaisampayana continued, ‘Hearing these accursed words couched in harsh syllabus,\\nYudhishthira, O king, approaching the Yaksha who had spoken then, stood there. And\\nthat bull among the Bharatas then beheld that Yaksha of unusual eyes and huge body\\ntall like a palmyra-palm and looking like fire or the Sun, and irresistible and gigantic\\nlike a mountain, staying on a tree, and uttering a loud roar deep as that of the clouds.\\nAnd the Yaksha said, “These thy brothers, O king, repeatedly forbidden by me, would\\nforcibly take away water. It is for this that they have been slain by me! He that wisheth\\nto live, should not, O king, drink this water! O son of Pritha, act not rashly! This\\nlake hath already been in my possession. Do thou, O son of Kunti, first answer my\\nquestions, and then take away as much as thou likest!” Yudhishthira said, “I do not, O\\n2\\uf779\\uf761\\uf76b\\uf773\\uf768\\uf761 \\uf770\\uf772\\uf761\\uf773\\uf768\\uf76e\\uf761\\nYaksha, covet, what is already in thy possession! O bull among male beings, virtuous\\npersons never approve that one should applaud his own self. Without boasting, I shall,\\ntherefore, answer thy questions, according to my intelligence. Do thou ask me!”\\n१· 1\\nThe Yaksha then said, “What is it that maketh the Sun rise? Who keeps him\\ncompany? Who causeth him to set? And in whom is he established?” Yudhishthira\\nanswered, “Brahma maketh the Sun rise: the gods keep him company: Dharma causeth\\nhim to set: and he is established in truth.”\\n२· 2\\nThe Yaksha asked, “By what doth one become learned? By what doth he attain\\nwhat is very great? How can one have a second? And, O king, how can one acquire\\nintelligence?” Yudhishthira answered, “It is by the study of the Srutis that a person\\nbecometh learned; it is by ascetic austerities that one acquireth what is very great: it\\nis by intelligence that a person acquireth a second and it is by serving the old that\\none becometh wise.”\\n३· 3\\nThe Yaksha asked, “What constituteth the divinity of the Brahmanas? What\\neven is their practice that is like that of the pious? What also is the human\\nattribute of the Brahmanas? And what practice of theirs is like that of the impious?”\\nYudhishthira answered, “The study of the Vedas constitutes their divinity: their\\nasceticism constitutes behaviour that is like that of the pious; their liability to death\\nis their human attribute and slander is their impiety.”\\n४· 4\\nThe Yaksha asked, “What institutes the divinity of the Kshatriyas? What even is\\ntheir practice that is like that of the pious? What is their human attribute? And what\\npractice of theirs is like that of the impious?” Yudhishthira answered, “Arrows and\\nweapons are their divinity: celebration of sacrifices is that act which is like that of the\\npious: liability to fear is their human attribute; and refusal of protection is that act of\\ntheirs which is like that of the impious.”\\n५· 5\\nThe Yaksha asked, “What is that which constitutes the Sama of the sacrifice? What\\nthe Yajus of the sacrifice? What is that which is the refuge of a sacrifice? And what is\\nthat which sacrifice cannot do without?”1Yudhishthira answered, “Life is the Sama of\\nthe sacrifice; the mind is the Yajus of the sacrifice: the Rikis that which is the refuge\\nof the sacrifice; and it is Rikalone which sacrifice cannot do without.”\\n६· 6\\nThe Yaksha asked, “What is of the foremost value to those that cultivate? What is\\nof the foremost value to those that sow? What is of the foremost value to those that\\nwish for prosperity in this world? And what is of the foremost value to those that\\n1The reference is to the first three of the four vedas, Rigveda ,Samaveda and Yajurveda , and also to\\nthe original meaning of their names: rik, praise or sacred verse; sama , melody; yajus , sacrificial formula.\\n3\\uf779\\uf761\\uf76b\\uf773\\uf768\\uf761 \\uf770\\uf772\\uf761\\uf773\\uf768\\uf76e\\uf761\\nbring forth?” Yudhishthira answered, “That which is of the foremost value to those\\nthat cultivate is rain: that of the foremost value to those that sow is seed: that of the\\nforemost value to those that bring forth is offspring.”\\n७· 7\\nThe Yaksha asked, “What person, enjoying all the objects of the senses, endued\\nwith intelligence, regarded by the world and liked by all beings, though breathing, is\\nnot yet alive?” Yudhishthira answered, “The person, who does not offer anything to\\nthese five: gods, guests, servants, ancestors ( pitris), and himself, though endued with\\nbreath, is not yet alive.”\\n८· 8\\nThe Yaksha asked, “What is weightier than the earth itself? What is higher than\\nthe heavens?” What is fleeter than the wind? And what is more numerous than\\ngrass?” Yudhishthira answered, “The mother is weightier than the earth; the father is\\nhigher than the heaven; the mind is fleeter than the wind; and our thoughts are more\\nnumerous than grass.”\\n९· 9\\nThe Yaksha asked, “What is that which doth not close its eyes while asleep; What is\\nthat which doth not move after birth? What is that which is without heart? And what\\nis that which swells with its own impetus?” Yudhishthira answered, “A fish doth not\\nclose its eyes while asleep: an egg doth not move after birth: a stone is without heart:\\nand a river swelleth with its own impetus.”\\n१०· 10\\nThe Yaksha asked, “Who is the friend of the exile? Who is the friend of the\\nhouseholder? Who is the friend of him that ails? And who is the friend of one about\\nto die?” Yudhishthira answered, “The friend of the exile in a distant land is his\\ncompanion, the friend of the householder is the wife; the friend of him that ails is\\nthe physician: and the friend of him about to die is charity.\\n११· 11\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“Who is the guest of all creatures? What is the eternal duty?\\nWhat, O foremost of kings, is Amrita ?2And what is this entire Universe?” Yudhishthira\\nanswered,—Agni is the guest of all creatures: the milk of kine is amrita :Homa\\ntherewith is the eternal duty: and this Universe consists of air alone.”\\n१२· 12\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“What is that which sojourneth alone? What is that which is\\nre-born after its birth? What is the remedy against cold? And what is the largest field?”\\n2Amrita अमƼत, ambrosia, the nectar of immortality. Homa हवन, a ritual in which a consecrated fire is\\nthe central element.\\n4\\uf779\\uf761\\uf76b\\uf773\\uf768\\uf761 \\uf770\\uf772\\uf761\\uf773\\uf768\\uf76e\\uf761\\nYudhishthira answered,—“The sun sojourneth alone; the moon takes birth anew: fire\\nis the remedy against cold: and the Earth is the largest field.”\\n१३· 13\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“What is the highest refuge of virtue? What of fame? What of\\nheaven? And what, of happiness?” Yudhishthira answered,—“Liberality is the highest\\nrefuge of virtue: gift, of fame: truth, of heaven: and good behaviour, of happiness.”\\n१४· 14\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“What is the soul of man? Who is that friend bestowed on\\nman by the gods? What is man’s chief support? And what also is his chief refuge?”\\nYudhishthira answered,—“The son is a man’s soul: the wife is the friend bestowed on\\nman by the gods; the clouds are his chief support; and gift is his chief refuge.”\\n१५· 15\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“What is the best of all laudable things? What is the most\\nvaluable of all his possessions? What is the best of all gains? And what is the best\\nof all kinds of happiness?” Yudhishthira answered,—”The best of all laudable things\\nis skill; the best of all possessions is knowledge: the best of all gains is health: and\\ncontentment is the best of all kinds of happiness.”\\n१६· 16\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“What is the highest duty in the world? What is that virtue\\nwhich always beareth fruit? What is that which if controlled, leadeth not to regret?\\nAnd who are they with whom an alliance cannot break?” Yudhishthira answered,—\\n“The highest of duties is to refrain from injury: the rites ordained in the Three Vedas\\nalways bear fruit: the mind, if controlled, leadeth to no regret: and an alliance with\\nthe good never breaketh.”\\n१७· 17\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“What is that which, if renounced, maketh one agreeable?\\nWhat is that which, if renounced, leadeth to no regret? What is that which, if\\nrenounced, maketh one wealthy? And what is that which if renounced, maketh one\\nhappy?” Yudhishthira answered,—“Pride, if renounced, maketh one agreeable; wrath,\\nif renounced leadeth to no regret: desire, if renounced, maketh one wealthy: and\\navarice, if renounced, maketh one happy.”\\n१८· 18\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“For what doth one give away to Brahmanas? For what to\\nmimes and dancers? For what to servants? And for what to king?” Yudhishthira\\nanswered,—“It is for religious merit that one giveth away to Brahmanas: it is for\\nfame that one giveth away to mimes and dancers: it is for supporting them that one\\ngiveth away to servants: and it is for obtaining relief from fear that one giveth to\\nkings.”\\n१९· 19\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“With what is the world enveloped? What is that owing to\\nwhich a thing cannot discover itself? For what are friends forsaken? And for what\\n5\\uf779\\uf761\\uf76b\\uf773\\uf768\\uf761 \\uf770\\uf772\\uf761\\uf773\\uf768\\uf76e\\uf761\\ndoth one fail to go to heaven?” Yudhishthira answered,—“The world is enveloped\\nwith darkness. Darkness doth not permit a thing to show itself. It is from avarice that\\nfriends are forsaken. And it is connection with the world for which one faileth to go\\nto heaven.”\\n२०· 20\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“For what may one be considered as dead? For what may a\\nkingdom be considered as dead? For what may a Sraddha be considered as dead? And\\nfor what, a sacrifice?” Yudhishthira answered,—“For want of wealth may a man be\\nregarded as dead. A kingdom for want of a king may be regarded as dead. A Sraddha\\nthat is performed with the aid of a priest that hath no learning may be regarded as\\ndead. And a sacrifice in which there are no gifts to Brahmanas is dead.”\\n२१· 21\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“What constitutes the way? What, hath been spoken of as\\nwater? What, as food? And what, as poison? Tell us also what is the proper time\\nof a Sraddha, and then drink and take away as much as thou likest!” Yudhishthira\\nanswered,—“They that are good constitute the way. 1 Space hath been spoken of\\nas water. 2 The cow is food. 3 A request is poison. And a Brahmana is regarded as\\nthe proper time of a Sraddha. 4 I do not know what thou mayst think of all this, O\\nYaksha?”\\n२२· 22\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“What hath been said to be the sign of asceticism? And what\\nis true restraint? What constitutes forgiveness. And what is shame?” Yudhishthira\\nanswered,—“Staying in one’s own religion is asceticism: the restraint of the mind is\\nof all restraints the true one: forgiveness consists in enduring enmity; and shame, in\\nwithdrawing from all unworthy acts.”\\n२३· 23\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“What, O king is said to be knowledge? What, tranquillity?\\nWhat constitutes mercy? And what hath been called simplicity?” Yudhishthira\\nanswered,—“True knowledge is that of Divinity. True tranquillity is that of the heart.\\nMercy consists in wishing happiness to all. And simplicity is equanimity of heart.”\\n२४· 24\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“What enemy is invincible? What constitutes an incurable\\ndisease for man? What sort of a man is called honest and what dishonest?”\\nYudhishthira answered,—“Anger is an invincible enemy. Covetousness constitutes\\nan incurable disease. He is honest that desires the weal of all creatures, and he is\\ndishonest who is unmerciful.”\\n२५· 25\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“What, O king, is ignorance? And what is pride? What\\nalso is to be understood by idleness? And what hath been spoken of as grief?”\\nYudhishthira answered,—“True ignorance consists in not knowing one’s duties. Pride\\n6\\uf779\\uf761\\uf76b\\uf773\\uf768\\uf761 \\uf770\\uf772\\uf761\\uf773\\uf768\\uf76e\\uf761\\nis a consciousness of one’s being himself an actor or sufferer in life. Idleness consists\\nin not discharging one’s duties, and ignorance in grief.”\\n२६· 26\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“What hath steadiness been said by the Rishis to be? And\\nwhat, patience? What also is a real ablution? And what is charity?” Yudhishthira\\nanswered,—“Steadiness consists in one’s staying in one’s own religion, and true\\npatience consists in the subjugation of the senses. A true bath consists in washing\\nthe mind clean of all impurities, and charity consists in protecting all creatures.”\\n२७· 27\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“What man should be regarded as learned, and who should be\\ncalled an atheist? Who also is to be called ignorant? What is called desire and what\\nare the sources of desire? And what is envy?” Yudhishthira answered,—“He is to be\\ncalled learned who knoweth his duties. An atheist is he who is ignorant and so also\\nhe is ignorant who is an atheist. Desire is due to objects of possession, and envy is\\nnothing else than grief of heart.”\\n२८· 28\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“What is pride, and what is hypocrisy? What is the grace of the\\ngods, and what is wickedness?” Yudhishthira answered,—“Stolid ignorance is pride.\\nThe setting up of a religious standard is hypocrisy. The grace of the gods is the fruit\\nof our gifts, and wickedness consists in speaking ill of others.”\\n२९· 29\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“Virtue, profit, and desire are opposed to one another.\\nHow could things thus antagonistic to one another exist together?” Yudhishthira\\nanswered,—“When a wife and virtue agree with each other, then all the three thou\\nhast mentioned may exist together.”\\n३०· 30\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“O bull of the Bharata race, who is he that is condemned\\nto everlasting hell? It behoveth thee to soon answer the question that I ask!”\\nYudhishthira answered,—“He that summoneth a poor Brahmana promising to make\\nhim a gift and then tells him that he hath nothing to give, goeth to everlasting hell. He\\nalso must go to everlasting hell, who imputes falsehood to the Vedas, the scriptures,\\nthe Brahmanas, the gods, and the ceremonies in honour of the Pitris, He also goeth to\\neverlasting hell who though in possession of wealth, never giveth away nor enjoyeth\\nhimself from avarice, saying, he hath none.”\\n३१· 31\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“By what, O king, birth, behaviour, study, or learning doth\\na person become a Brahmana ? Tell us with certitude!” Yudhishthira answered,-\\n“Listen, O Yaksha! It is neither birth, nor study, nor learning, that is the cause of\\nBrahmanahood, without doubt, it is behaviour that constitutes it. One’s behaviour\\nshould always be well-guarded, especially by a Brahmana . He who maintaineth his\\nconduct unimpaired, is never impaired himself. Professors and pupils, in fact, all who\\n7\\uf779\\uf761\\uf76b\\uf773\\uf768\\uf761 \\uf770\\uf772\\uf761\\uf773\\uf768\\uf76e\\uf761\\nstudy the scriptures, if addicted to wicked habits, are to be regarded as illiterate\\nwretches. He only is learned who performeth his religious duties. He even that hath\\nstudied the four Vedas is to be regarded as a wicked wretch scarcely distinguishable\\nfrom a Sudra if his conduct be not correct. He only who performeth the Agnihotra and\\nhath his senses under control, is called a Brahmana !”\\n३२· 32\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“What doth one gain that speaketh agreeable words? What\\ndoth he gain that always acteth with judgment? What doth he gain that hath many\\nfriends? And what he, that is devoted to virtue?’—Yudhishthira answered,—“He that\\nspeaketh agreeable words becometh agreeable to all. He that acteth with judgment\\nobtaineth whatever he seeketh. He that hath many friends liveth happily. And he that\\nis devoted to virtue obtaineth a happy state in the next world.”\\n३३· 33\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“Who is truly happy? What is most wonderful? What is the\\npath? And what is the news? Answer these four questions of mine and let thy\\ndead brothers revive.” Yudhishthira answered,—“O amphibious creature, a man who\\ncooketh in his own house, on the fifth or the sixth part of the day, with scanty\\nvegetables, but who is not in debt and who stirreth not from home, is truly happy. Day\\nafter day countless creatures are going to the abode of Yama, yet those that remain\\nbehind believe themselves to be immortal. What can be more wonderful than this?\\nArgument leads to no certain conclusion, the Srutis are different from one another;\\nthere is not even one Rishi whose opinion can be accepted by all; the truth about\\nreligion and duty is hid in caves: therefore, that alone is the path along which the\\ngreat have trod. This world full of ignorance is like a pan. The sun is fire, the days\\nand nights are fuel. The months and the seasons constitute the wooden ladle. Time is\\nthe cook that is cooking all creatures in that pan with such aids; this is the news.”\\nॐ\\nThe Yaksha asked,—“Thou hast, O represser of foes, truly answered all my questions!\\nTell us now who is truly a man, and what man truly possesseth every kind of\\nwealth.” Yudhishthira answered,—“The report of one’s good action reacheth heaven\\nand spreadeth over the earth. As long as that report lasteth, so long is a person to\\nwhom the agreeable and the disagreeable, weal and woe, the past and the future, are\\nthe same, is said to possess every kind of wealth.”\\nThe Yaksha said,—“Thou hast, O king truly answered who is a man, and what\\nman possesseth every kind of wealth. Therefore, let one only amongst thy brothers,\\nwhom thou mayst wish, get up with life!” Yudhishthira answered,—“Let this one\\nthat is of darkish hue, whose eyes are red, who is tall like a large Sala tree, whose\\nchest is broad and arms long, let this Nakula, O Yaksha, get up with life! The Yaksha\\nrejoined,—“This Bhimasena is dear unto thee, and this Arjuna also is one upon whom\\nall of you depend! Why, then, O king dost thou, wish a step-brother to get up with his\\nlife! How canst thou, forsaking Bhima whose strength is equal to that of ten thousand\\nelephants, wish Nakula to live? People said that this Bhima was dear to thee. From\\n8\\uf779\\uf761\\uf76b\\uf773\\uf768\\uf761 \\uf770\\uf772\\uf761\\uf773\\uf768\\uf76e\\uf761\\nwhat motive then dost thou wish a step-brother to revive? Forsaking Arjuna the might\\nof whose arm is worshipped by all the sons of Pandu, why dost thou wish Nakula to\\nrevive?” Yudhishthira said,—“If virtue is sacrificed, he that sacrificeth it, is himself\\nlost. So virtue also cherisheth the cherisher. Therefore taking care that virtue by being\\nsacrificed may not sacrifice us, I never forsake virtue. Abstention from injury is the\\nhighest virtue, and is, I ween, even higher than the highest object of attainment. I\\nendeavour to practise that virtue. Therefore, let Nakula, O Yaksha, revive! Let men\\nknow that the king is always virtuous! I will never depart from my duty. Let Nakula,\\ntherefore, revive! My father had two wives, Kunti and Madri. Let both of them have\\nchildren. This is what I wish. As Kunti is to me, so also is Madri. There is no difference\\nbetween them in my eye. I desire to act equally towards my mothers. Therefore, let\\nNakula live?” The Yaksha said,—“Since abstention from injury is regarded by thee\\nas higher than both profit and pleasure, therefore, let all thy brothers live, O bull of\\nBharata race!”’\\nॐ\\nVaisampayana continued,—‘Then agreeable to the words of the Yaksha the Pandavas\\nrose up; and in a moment their hunger and thirst left them. Thereupon Yudhishthira\\nsaid, “I ask thee that art incapable of being vanquished and that standest on one leg\\nin the tank, what god art thou, for I cannot take thee for a Yaksha! Art thou the\\nforemost of the Vasus, or of the Rudras, or of the chief of the Maruts? Or art thou the\\nlord himself of the celestials, wielder of the thunder-bolt! Each of these my brothers\\nis capable of fighting as hundred thousand warriors, and I see not the warrior that\\ncan slay them all! I see also that their senses have refreshed, as if they have sweetly\\nawaked from slumber. Art thou a friend of ours, or even our father himself? At this the\\nYaksha replied,—“O child, I am even thy father, the Lord of justice, possessed of great\\nprowess! Know, bull of the Bharata race, that I came hither desirous of beholding thee!\\nFame, truth, self-restraint, purity, candour, modesty, steadiness, charity, austerities\\nand Brahmacharya ,3these are my body! And abstention from injury, impartiality,\\npeace, penances, sanctity, and freedom from malice are the doors through which I\\nam accessible. Thou art always dear to me! By good luck thou art devoted to the five;\\nand by good luck also thou hast conquered the six. Of the six, two appear in the first\\npart of life; two in the middle part thereof; and the remaining two at the end, in order\\nto make men repair to the next world. I am, good betide thee, the lord of justice!\\nI came hither to test thy merit. I am well-pleased to witness thy harmlessness; and,\\nO sinless one, I will confer boons on thee. Do thou, O foremost of kings, ask of me\\nboons. I shall surely confer them, O sinless one! Those that revere me, never come by\\ndistress!’ Yudhishthira said,—“A deer was carrying away the Brahmana’s fire-sticks.\\nTherefore, the first boon that I shall ask, is, may that Brahmana’s adorations to Agni\\nbe not interrupted!’ The Yaksha said,—“O Kunti’s son endued with splendour, it was\\n3Brahmacharya is the term used for the practice of self-imposed celibate discipline that accompanies\\nthe pursuit of religious studies, and it refers particularly to the first stage of life, when the young student\\ndevotes exclusively to learning and laying the foundation of a pious life.\\n9\\uf779\\uf761\\uf76b\\uf773\\uf768\\uf761 \\uf770\\uf772\\uf761\\uf773\\uf768\\uf76e\\uf761\\nI who for examining thee, was carrying away, in the guise of a deer, that Brahmana’s\\nfire-sticks!”\\nVaisampayana continued,—‘Thereupon that worshipful one said,—“I give thee this\\nboon! Good betide thee! O thou that are like unto an immortal, ask thou a fresh\\nboon! Yudhishthira said,—“We have spent these twelve years in the forest; and the\\nthirteenth year is come. May no one recognise us, as we spend this year somewhere.”\\nVaisampayana continued,—‘Thereat that worshipful one replied,—‘I give this boon\\nunto thee!’ And then reassuring Kunti’s son having truth for prowess, he also said,\\n“Even if, O Bharata, ye range this entire earth in your proper forms none in the three\\nworlds shall recognise you. Ye perpetuators of the Kuru race, through my grace, ye\\nwill spend this thirteenth year, secretly and unrecognised, in Virata’s kingdom! And\\nevery one of you will be able at will to assume any form he likes! Do ye now present\\nthe Brahmana with his fire-sticks. It was only to test you that I carried them away in\\nthe form of a deer! O amiable Yudhishthira, do thou ask for another boon that thou\\nmayst like! I will confer it on thee. O foremost of men, I have not yet been satisfied\\nby granting boons to thee! Do thou my son, accept a third boon that is great and\\nincomparable! Thou, O king, art born of me, and Vidura of portion or mine!” Thereat\\nYudhishthira said,—“It is enough that I have beheld thee with my senses, eternal God\\nof gods as thou art! O father, whatever boon thou wilt confer on me I shall surely\\naccept gladly! May I, O lord, always conquer covetousness and folly and anger, and\\nmay my mind be ever devoted to charity, truth, and ascetic austerities! The Lord of\\njustice said,—“Even by nature, O Pandava, hast thou been endued with these qualities,\\nfor thou art the Lord of justice himself! Do thou again attain what thou asked for!”\\nVaisampayana continued,—‘Having said these words, the worshipful Lord of justice,\\nwho is the object of contemplation of all the worlds, vanished therefrom; and the\\nhigh-souled Pandavas after they had slept sweetly were united with one another. And\\ntheir fatigue dispelled, those heroes returned to the hermitage, and gave back that\\nBrahmana his firesticks. That man who pursueth this illustrious and fame-enhancing\\nstory of the revival of the Pandavas and the meeting of father and son (Dharma and\\nYudhishthira), obtaineth perfect tranquillity of mind, and sons and grandsons, and\\nalso a life extending over a hundred years! And the mind of that man that layeth this\\nstory to heart, never delighteth in unrighteousness, or in disunion among friends, or\\nmisappropriation of other person’s property, or staining other people’s wives, or in\\nfoul thoughts!’\\nTranslation by Kisari Mohan Ganguli\\nRepublished by\\nThe Matheson Trust\\n10'"
